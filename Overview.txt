I made Python scripts for creating shelf_value barcodes and to importing shelf
values into our retail stores database.
It is by far quicker and more convenient than bringing all items to the counter, scan one item
at a time and manually type in the shelf value on our POS-system.

Feel free to use, adjust or whatever suits your usecase.
